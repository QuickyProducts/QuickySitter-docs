Customer-facing changes only, and each entry is tagged **Fix** (bug fix) or **Feature** (new). Routine internal/technical changes aren't listed. Newest version on top.

## Version 1.25

*Version numbers of QuickySitter and the QuickySitter Pro creator kit are unified from this release on. QuickySitter jumps from 1.04 to 1.25 to meet the kit. Same product, no release was skipped.*

- **Feature**: Prop scale & worn-fit support: props equipped with the `[QS]objectadjust` script (drop it into your prop next to `[AV]object`) can be resized in the editor, or fitted directly on the body for attachment props, and saved with `[SAVE]`. No more take-back-and-replace loop. Owners can also fine-tune a rezzed prop's size by touch (±1/5/10 % menu, `[RESTORE]`).
- **Feature**: New "Adjust" access level in the `[SECURITY]` menu (OWNER / GROUP / ALL, default OWNER): it lets chosen non-owners use the adjust tools (`[HELPER]` and the QuickyHUD adjust mode). Handy when a store account owns the furniture but you build from your personal account: set it to GROUP and both accounts just need the store group.
- **Feature**: The `[DUMP]` settings-copy web page now shows the familiar classic AVsitter layout, with all pose and menu lines together and the position data grouped below.
- **Fix**: On furniture with many poses and props the prop script could run out of memory and crash on early 1.25 (visible as "Stack-Heap Collision" in chat, and the Quicky HUD no longer attached).
- **Fix**: That crash could also leave corrupted prop records stored in the furniture, so later the wrong prop appeared instead of the intended one (or instead of the Quicky HUD). Corrupted records are now detected, discarded, and rebuilt automatically, including ones left behind before the update.
- **Fix**: `[DUMP]` no longer lists the internal "QSDYN" entries the Quicky HUD registers for its automatic attach, so they stop showing up as bogus PROP lines when you paste a dump back into the AVpos notecard (the HUD recreates them on demand; already-pasted lines keep working and simply vanish from the next dump).
- **Fix**: The `[HELPER]` `[DUMP]` "Settings copy" link now uses the QuickySitter dump service; the old avsitter.com page it pointed to no longer works.

## Version 1.04

- **Feature**: Plugins can now add their own buttons to the `[ADJUST]` menu. Used by the new QuickyHUD Animesh partner-dummy plugin (set up couples / group poses without a second avatar).

## Version 1.03

- **Fix**: The first sit after the furniture had been idle a while now plays the proper animation right away (in rare cases it could show the default pose until you re-sat).

## Version 1.02

- **Fix**: `[QS]select` dialog throttle.
- **Fix**: `[DUMP]` no longer freezes when a plugin stops responding; it skips the unresponsive plugin, finishes the dump, and posts a notice naming it.
- **Fix**: `[DUMP]` no longer fails with "too many HTTP requests" on large configs, because the output is paced to stay under Second Life's rate limit, so the settings link comes out complete (and warns instead of silently truncating if a limit is ever hit).
