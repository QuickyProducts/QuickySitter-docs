Customer-facing changes only, and each entry is tagged **Fix** (bug fix) or **Feature** (new). Routine internal/technical changes aren't listed. Newest version on top.

## Version 1.04

- **Feature**: Plugins can now add their own buttons to the `[ADJUST]` menu. Used by the new QuickyHUD Animesh partner-dummy plugin (set up couples / group poses without a second avatar).

## Version 1.03

- **Fix**: The first sit after the furniture had been idle a while now plays the proper animation right away (in rare cases it could show the default pose until you re-sat).

## Version 1.02

- **Fix**: `[QS]select` dialog throttle.
- **Fix**: `[DUMP]` no longer freezes when a plugin stops responding; it skips the unresponsive plugin, finishes the dump, and posts a notice naming it.
- **Fix**: `[DUMP]` no longer fails with "too many HTTP requests" on large configs, because the output is paced to stay under Second Life's rate limit, so the settings link comes out complete (and warns instead of silently truncating if a limit is ever hit).
